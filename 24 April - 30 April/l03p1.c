/*
 * Explanation of the changes:
 * stdlib.h library was added for exit() function.
 * Typo in the ISBITSET macro fixed, the P0S was replaced with POS.
 * j variable in the for-loop in generateSets() function was initialized instead of declared, and the comparison operator in the for-loop condition was changed from == to <.
 * The printf function for the output of the subsets was missing a newline character.
 * & was added before largest_num in the sscanf function, so that it can correctly read the value from the command line argument.
 * The format specifier for the output of res in the printf function was changed to %d to match the data type of the variable.
